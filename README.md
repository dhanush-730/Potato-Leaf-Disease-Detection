# Potato Leaf Disease Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
Potato Leaf Disease Detection is a machine learning-based project aimed at identifying diseases in potato leaves using image classification techniques. By leveraging deep learning models, the system can accurately predict diseases, helping farmers take timely action.

## ðŸ”¥ Features
- **Image-based disease detection**: Upload an image of a potato leaf and get a prediction.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive UI for easy use.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Fast and efficient predictions.
- **Scalability**: Can be expanded to detect diseases in other plants.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Framework**: Flask (if applicable for web deployment)
- **Dataset**: [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)

## ðŸš€ Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhanush-730/Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection.git
   cd Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py  # If a Flask app is used
   ```

## ðŸ“· Usage
- Run the application and upload an image of a potato leaf.
- The model will process the image and classify it into healthy or diseased.
- The result will be displayed with confidence scores.

## ðŸ“Š Model Training (For Developers)
1. **Prepare Dataset**: Ensure images are structured in proper training & testing folders.
2. **Train the Model**:
   ```python
   python train.py  # Modify accordingly based on training script
   ```
3. **Save and Evaluate**: The trained model will be saved for later use.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy with better data augmentation.
- Deploy as a web or mobile application.
- Expand to detect multiple plant diseases.
